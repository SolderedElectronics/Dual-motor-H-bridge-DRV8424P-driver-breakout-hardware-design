The Dual Motor H-Bridge DRV8424P is a high-performance motor driver module that provides efficient and reliable control for two DC motors or a bipolar stepper motor. It is widely used in robotics, automation, and mechatronics projects where precise motor control is required.

This motor driver module is based on the DRV8424P integrated circuit, which features advanced protection and control capabilities. It supports a wide range of motor voltages, typically from 8V to 45V, and can deliver a continuous output current of up to 2.5A per motor channel. With a peak current of up to 4A, it can handle high-demand applications.

Our DRV8424P comes with two easyC connectors for making connections fast and smooth without a fear of something going wrong.
